Hi, I'm Mustafa! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I recently completed my studies in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with a focus on Artificial Intelligence, and Iâ€™m excited to dive deeper into the world of development.

What I'm Working On
Iâ€™m currently working on an AI-powered crypto trading bot, a project I started to explore the world of trading, which I have limited experience in. My goal is to see if I can develop a bot that can trade on my behalf while also learning new, valuable skills along the way. This project is helping me grow as a developer and gain a deeper understanding of both AI and financial markets.

My Journey
Throughout my learning journey, Iâ€™ve found that I learn best in real-world scenarios outside of the classroom. Whether it was learning how to cut hair or gaining hands-on experience at various workplaces, these experiences have taught me valuable skills and how to approach challenges with a practical mindset. I thrive in environments where I can apply my knowledge to solve real problems, and I enjoy working with a mentor or supervisor to ensure that the work is meaningful and aligned with the best practices.

Skills and Interests
Programming Languages: Python, Java, and more.
Areas of Expertise: OOP, AI, and software development.
Current Focus: AI applications in real-world scenarios.
Let's Connect!
Iâ€™m eager to join a team where I can contribute and grow into a well-rounded developer. If you're looking for a passionate, driven, and quick-learning individual, feel free to reach out!
